# BREAST-CANCER-CLASSIFICATION

Problem Statement :

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the world. Early detection of breast cancer is essential in reducing their life losses. Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to predict whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

KNN algorithm is used to classify the type of cancer.

I have downloaded the WISCONSIN dataset from the Kaggle website and will work upon them by loading them to visual studio.

Based on this parameters I build and train a model which classifies a type of cancer. It has 30 parameters.
